# ServiceNow Location Loader

## Summary

Loads ServiceNow location model with coordinate locations for each facility, all
levels for each facility and all units for each level and models the hierarchy
relationship between the units, levels and facilities.

## Usage

-   The tool accepts Facilities, Levels and Units layers as input.

-   The person accessing the supplied ServiceNow rest endpoint must have
    Read/Write privileges in the ServiceNow cmn_location table.

-   The tool loads the ServiceNow location model with location name and centroid
    latitude and longitude coordinate information for the units, levels and
    facilities.

-   The Levels layer should contain a FACILITY_ID field that associates that
    level with a feature in the Facilities layer.

-   The Units layer should contain a LEVEL_ID field that associates that unit
    with a feature in the Levels layer.

-   The tool populates the address information along with coordinates, if
    available in the data. It will load the parent facilityâ€™s address for all
    the spaces contained within.

-   The following fields will be populated in the ServiceNow location table:
    Name, Street, City, State / Province, Zip / Postal Code, Country, Parent,
    Latitude, Longitude.

-   ServiceNow is expecting coordinates in a geographic coordinate system. Data
    in other coordinate systems will be projected to Geographic by the tool.

## Code samples

### ServiceNowLocationLoader example 1 (Python window)

The following code sample demonstrates how to use the tool to load data in
ServiceNow location model with duplicates.

```
import arcpy
arcpy.ImportToolbox("C:\\Projects\\GitHub\\arcgis-indoors\\integrations\\servicenow\\Python Tool\\ServiceNow.pyt")
arcpy.ServiceNow.ServiceNowLocationLoader("Facilities", "Levels", "Units",
"KEEP_DUPLICATE_VALUES", "https://servicenow-server.com/api/now/table/cmn_location", "userid", "*****")
```

### ServiceNowLocationLoader example 2 (stand-alone script)  
The following stand-alone script demonstrates how to use the tool to load data
in ServiceNow location model without duplicates.

```
# Name: ServiceNowLocationLoader_example2.py
# Description: The following stand-alone script demonstrates the usage of the tool to load data in ServiceNow location model without duplicates.

# Imports
import arcpy
arcpy.ImportToolbox("C:/Projects/GitHub/arcgis-indoors/integrations/servicenow/Python Tool/ServiceNow.pyt")

# Set variables
in_facility_layer = "C:/Indoors/AIIM_1_0_v1.gdb/AIIM/Facilities"
in_level_layer = "C:/Indoors/AIIM_1_0_v1.gdb/AIIM/Levels"
in_unit_layer = "C:/Indoors/AIIM_1_0_v1.gdb/AIIM/Units"
keepDuplicates = "NO_DUPLICATE_VALUES"
in_servicenow_url = "https://servicenow-server.com/api/now/table/cmn_location"
in_username = "userid"
in_password = "*****"

# Execute ServiceNowLocationLoader
arcpy.ServiceNow.ServiceNowLocationLoader(in_facility_layer, in_level_layer, in_unit_layer, keepDuplicates, in_servicenow_url, in_username, in_password)
```
